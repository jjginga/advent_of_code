# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 - Rust Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the **Advent of Code 2023**! This repository contains my solutions to the daily coding challenges, all implemented in the Rust programming language.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is organized as follows:

advent_of_code/
├── src/
│   ├── day01.rs         // Combined solution for Day 1 (Part 1 and Part 2)
│   ├── day02.rs         // Solution for Day 2
│   └── ...              // Other days' solutions
└── data/
    ├── day01.txt        // Input data for Day 1
    ├── day02.txt        // Input data for Day 2
    └── ...              // Other days' input data

- **`src/`**: Contains Rust source files, each named according to the day they solve.
- **`data/`**: Contains input files corresponding to each day's challenge.
